# LIS
The Longest Increasing Subsequence algorithm which is using to find a subsequence of a given sequence in which the subsequence's elements are in sorted order, lowest to highest, and in which the subsequence is as long as possible. The longest increasing subsequence problem is solvable in time O(n log n), where n denotes the length of the input sequence.
